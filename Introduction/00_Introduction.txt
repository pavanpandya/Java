1. JDK vs JRE vs JVM:

- JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
- It will have Developing Tools, compiler and runtime environment which will
help us write the Java programs and execute them.
- When we install JDK, we we get two more things:
    1. JRE
    2. JVM
- So, Once we compile the program, we need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to 
execute the program. JRE will contain Java Class Library and JVM. Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) will actually execute the program.

2. How everything works?

- Let's say we have a program named "first.java". We will used the compiler
known as "javac" (which is part of JDK) to compile our program. This compiler 
takes "first.java" and returns "first.class" file. 

- Now, to execute the program we will write "java first". This is done by JRE 
and internally it used JVM.
